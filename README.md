# ThinkTank-Virtual-Map
Group repository for the collaborative practice module

The ThinkTank Virtual Map project has been created for ThinkTank to possibly use in their vehicles and engines section of the building. 
It features a 2D map where users can select a location to go to and view the models found there along with information and facts about them.

The main target audience for this project is people who have difficulty getting around ThinkTank when the area is crowded, the device used is 
going to be a tablet with a touchscreen as we believe this is the most accessible device.
